  <h1>Anatomy of a CSS Rule</h1>
  <h2>Subheading1</h2>
  <p>
    In this cursed world we live in, it is a cycle of hatred that will not cease. You and I seek the same thing that Jiraiya-sensei wanted. Let me ask you this: How will you confront this hatred in order to create peace?
  </p>
  <h2>subheading2</h2>
  <p>just by living, people hurt others without even realizing it. So long as humanity exists, hate will also exist. There is no peace in this cursed world. War is just a crime paid for by the pain of the defeated.</p>
