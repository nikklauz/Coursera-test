      Rodrigo De Paul: ‚ÄúWas there disrespect on gestures? It‚Äôs nonsense to talk about it now. That stays on the pitch. This is football, Uruguay did better tonight and now we have to get up and play a great game in Brazil. Uruguay did very well. Sometimes it's also time to lose. The important thing is what happens from now on.

‚ÄúSometimes football is unfair. We have to take care of everything we earned, we achieved, all the respect we have earned in this time. That‚Äôs done inside the pitch and nothing else.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe upcoming match is attractive. Brazil - Argentina is always very different. It's a classic, in the Maracan√£, that we have a nice memory of the last time... It's going to be a very difficult game but we're ready and we will prepare the match with the respect that Brazil deserves for the great national team they are.‚Äù
N1m was allocated to the Ongoing Reconstruction of Bida-Lambata Road in Niger state (ERGP12172976) in the 2023 FG Budget.

We tracked and report that the road section along Lamabata was poorly done, with drainage on both sides of the road, while Bida section has not been done.

We call on 
@PWHNIG
, the implementing agency to call the contractor back to correct the shoddy job done on Lamabata road. We will keep tracking this project to ensure that quality work is done.Marcus Thuram: "When I was 10 I went to see my father's training session in Barcelona and I didn't have boots. Messi was young, and after training I wanted to go to the pitch with the other children to play. Leo was wearing almost the same shoes size as me. Messi lent me his boots, I played and then he told me 'take them'. At 10 years old, I didn't realize what had just happened, so the next day I gave them to a friend. I regret it."

      If you want happiness in your life, don't try to be rich. Colonel Okwechime told me this and I didn't get it at the time. The day I finally did was when FTX crashed. I stopped trying and started doing things that made me happy. I stayed with my family more and started exercising.
